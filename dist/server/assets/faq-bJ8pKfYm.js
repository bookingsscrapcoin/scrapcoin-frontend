  title: "Booking & Service",
  items: [{
    q: "How do I book a scrap pickup?",
    a: "Fill in the booking form on our homepage — just enter your name, WhatsApp number, society/sector name, tower and flat number, preferred pickup date, and select the scrap categories you have. We will confirm your pickup slot via WhatsApp."
  }, {
    q: "Which areas do you currently serve?",
    a: "We currently serve Greater Noida, Indirapuram, and Noida. We are expanding rapidly to other NCR zones soon."
  }, {
    q: "Is there a minimum weight quantity?",
    a: "No, there is no strict minimum weight requirement. You can book for whatever recyclables you have. However, bookings with very small quantities (under 5 kg total) may be rescheduled or combined with nearby pickups in your sector at our discretion."
  }, {
    q: "Can I schedule a pickup for the same day?",
    a: "Bookings should be made at least 12 hours in advance so we can map routes and assign a collector to your area. For urgent same-day bulk requests, please message us directly on WhatsApp and we will do our best to accommodate."
  }, {
    q: "What are your operational days and timings?",
    a: "We operate Monday to Saturday, from 9 AM to 6 PM. Sunday pickups can sometimes be scheduled upon special request via WhatsApp."
  }]
}, {
  title: "Weighing & Payouts",
  items: [{
    q: "How is the scrap weight calculated?",
    a: "We use calibrated digital scale machines. You can inspect the scale reading yourself during collection — we encourage complete transparency, and there are no rounding deductions or estimation tricks."
  }, {
    q: "When and how do I get paid?",
    a: "Payment is settled on the spot immediately after weighing, via UPI transfer (GPay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc.). You receive the money in your bank account before our collector leaves."
  }, {
    q: "Where can I check today's scrap prices?",
    a: "Real-time rates are published on our Rates page (scrapco.in/rates) and are updated regularly in line with commodity market values. The rates published are exactly what you get paid."
  }]
}, {
  title: "Accepted Materials",
  items: [{
    q: "What types of scrap do you accept?",
    a: "We collect paper, cardboard, plastic items (PET bottles, containers, mixed clean plastics), metals (iron, steel, aluminium, brass, copper), and e-waste (laptops, phones, chargers, appliances, batteries)."
  }, {
    q: "What materials are prohibited?",
    a: "We do not accept hazardous chemical waste, medical or biomedical waste, liquid chemicals, radioactive materials, asbestos, or any items that pose a health/safety risk to our collectors."
  }]
}, {
  title: "Account & Dashboard",
  items: [{
    q: "Do I need to create an account to schedule a pickup?",
    a: "No, guest bookings are fully supported. However, creating a free account allows you to review your pickup history, monitor pending schedules, track your cumulative carbon diversion metrics, and store addresses for faster bookings."
  }, {
    q: "Can I cancel or reschedule a booking?",
    a: "Yes. You can cancel or reschedule up to 2 hours before the confirmed window. Log in to visit the 'My Bookings' page or message us directly on WhatsApp to make updates."
  }]
}, {
  title: "RWAs & Society Campaigns",
  items: [{
    q: "Can you host a society-wide scrap collection drive?",
    a: "Yes. We work closely with RWAs, building management, and green coordinators to organize monthly scrap collection drives. We provide society notice board templates, coordinate collectors, and clear bulk piles efficiently."
  }, {
    q: "Do society partners receive metrics reporting?",
    a: "Yes. RWA partners receive a free monthly environmental dashboard showing total weight recycled, landfill diversion rates, participating flat statistics, and estimated carbon offset equivalents."
